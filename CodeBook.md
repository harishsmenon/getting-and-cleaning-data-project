##Data Set Information:
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset was randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

##Data Transformations

###1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Downloads data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
and merges the training and test data files

###2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses grepl to extract varilables that contain means and standard deviations for each measurements

###3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
Merges measurement data with activity type to include descriptive activity names

###4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
Uses gsub to update variable names as follows:
* ^t --> time
* ^f --> frequency
* Acc --> Accelerometer
* Gyro --> Gyroscope
* Mag --> Magnitude
* BodyBody --> Body

###5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
Uses agregate function to summarize means for each activity and subject.
